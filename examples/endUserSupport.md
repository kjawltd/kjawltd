## END USER SUPPORT (EUS)

### Overview

End User Support (**EUS**) is a bespoke software solution which can be configured to meet any specific partner requirements, and integrated with any existing CRM systems.

EUS works as a customer service diagnostic tool. It can identify faults relating to a particular customer, then link to a set of instructions in an attempt to resolve the fault. The application’s **User Administration** function manages access and permission levels for different user groups (e.g. customer service agents and application administrators).

### Customer screen

The customer screen displays a summary of 4 levels of customer information. 

- Service - Details of the current service status and behaviour.
- Instance - Details of the connection information for the installed instance. From this panel, the instance configuration can be restarted, amended, reset to its factory defaults, and undergo an upgrade.
- Function - Details of each function connected to the instance. If a fault has occurred, the **Resolve** feature links the agent into a series of instructions designed to remedy the fault. If the fault cannot be resolved, the **Manage** feature links to a screen with options for removing the function, or displaying and exporting the function’s historical behaviour to identify ongoing or intermittent issues.
- Contacts - Details of each contact between the customer and customer services staff, including a log of messages sent and a test function to confirm customer contact details.

The screen also contains a list of links to key support modules.

- Support Log – Lists activities for the current and previous support sessions.
- Network - Displays the current network structure for installed functions.
- Customer Login – Accesses the customer UI with the same view as the customer.
- Function Log – Records details of function and service behaviour.
- Installation Trouble-Shooter - Helps to resolve issues when installing new functions (planned or manual upgrades).

### Security

EUS also offers security features. Access to customer details or UIs can be restricted or blocked, video and camera streams can be blocked for all agent users, and actions are captured in an audit log.

### User management

EUS supports several levels of user access within a customer support team, from agent to administrator, and constructs a view aimed at offering comprehensive and logical support processes and information flows.

Further information can be found in the Agent User Guide and the Administrator User Guide.
