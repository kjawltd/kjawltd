1.	Introduction

This document contains instructions on starting to use the API, describing the process required for both SOAP and REST access. It can be used as a supplement to the API User Guide, and is designed to support users in non – technical roles, with examples created using open source tools (SOAP UI and Postman).
2.	User setup – First time API access

To access the API for the first time, you’ll need to set up access from the client application. 
SoapUI is a software application which organises APIs into projects and helps to configure SOAP access parameters and REST URLs.
Postman is a REST client extension for the Google Chrome browser.
To complete the API user authentication process, you’ll need the following information.
•	Username and password for the API endpoint.
•	The WSDL URL (a page containing a description of the API service).
You can find more information about the authentication process in the API user guide.
 
3.	SOAP UI

•	From the File menu, select the New SOAP Project option to create a new project and enter the Project Name and WSDL endpoint. 
•	Click OK to save (Figure 1). The project name should now appear in the SOAPUI navigation pane on the left of the screen.
